    "text-to-image": "Generates images from input text. These models can be used to generate and modify images based on text prompts.",
    "image-to-text": "Image to text models output a text from a given image. Image captioning or optical character recognition can be considered as the most common applications of image to text.",
    "image-classification": "Image classification is the task of assigning a label or class to an entire image. Images are expected to have only one class for each image. Image classification models take an image as input and return a prediction about which class the image belongs to.",
    "object-detection": "Object Detection models allow users to identify objects of certain defined classes. Object detection models receive an image as input and output the images with bounding boxes and labels on detected objects.",
    "image-segmentation": "Image Segmentation divides an image into segments where each pixel in the image is mapped to an object. This task has multiple variants such as instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation and semantic segmentation.",
    "text-classification": "Text Classification is the task of assigning a label or class to a given text. Some use cases are sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and assessing grammatical correctness.",
    "token-classification": "Token classification is a natural language understanding task in which a label is assigned to some tokens in a text. Some popular token classification subtasks are Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging. NER models could be trained to identify specific entities in a text, such as dates, individuals and places; and PoS tagging would identify, for example, which words in a text are verbs, nouns, and punctuation marks.",
    "table-question-answering": "Table Question Answering (Table QA) is the answering a question about an information on a given table.",
    "question-answering": "Question Answering models can retrieve the answer to a question from a given text, which is useful for searching for an answer in a document. Some question answering models can generate answers without context!",
    "zero-shot-classification": "Zero-shot text classification is a task in natural language processing where a model is trained on a set of labeled examples but is then able to classify new examples from previously unseen classes.",
    "summarization": "Summarization is the task of producing a shorter version of a document while preserving its important information. Some models can extract text from the original input, while other models can generate entirely new text.",
    "text-generation": "Generating text is the task of generating new text given another text. These models can, for example, fill in incomplete text or paraphrase.",
    "fill-mask": "Masked language modeling is the task of masking some of the words in a sentence and predicting which words should replace those masks. These models are useful when we want to get a statistical understanding of the language in which the model is trained in.",
    "sentence-similarity": "Sentence Similarity is the task of determining how similar two texts are. Sentence similarity models convert input texts into vectors (embeddings) that capture semantic information and calculate how close (similar) they are between them. This task is particularly useful for information retrieval and clustering/grouping.",
    "text-to-speech": "Text-to-Speech (TTS) is the task of generating natural sounding speech given text input. TTS models can be extended to have a single model that generates speech for multiple speakers and multiple languages.",
    "text-to-audio": "Music Generation",
    "automatic-speech-recognition": "Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), also known as Speech to Text (STT), is the task of transcribing a given audio to text. It has many applications, such as voice user interfaces.",
    "audio-classification": "Audio classification is the task of assigning a label or class to a given audio. It can be used for recognizing which command a user is giving or the emotion of a statement, as well as identifying a speaker.",
    "document-question-answering": "Document Question Answering (also known as Document Visual Question Answering) is the task of answering questions on document images. Document question answering models take a (document, question) pair as input and return an answer in natural language. Models usually rely on multi-modal features, combining text, position of words (bounding-boxes) and image.",
    "zero-shot-image-classification": "Zero-shot image classification is the task of classifying previously unseen classes during training of a model."
